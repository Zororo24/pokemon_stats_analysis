## Project Overview

This analysis explores Pokemon statistics using Python, focusing on understanding patterns and relationships in Pokemon attributes. The project utilizes popular data science libraries including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Basic Analysis

### Data Cleaning
- Handles missing values in the dataset
- Removes duplicates if any
- Standardizes column names and data types
- Validates data integrity and consistency

### Frequency Analysis
- Analyzes Pokemon type distributions
- Examines generation-wise Pokemon counts
- Studies legendary vs non-legendary Pokemon ratios

### The Strongest and The Weakest
- Identifies Pokemon with highest/lowest attack stats
- Analyzes total base stats
- Compares special attack vs physical attack distributions

### The Fastest and The Slowest
- Ranks Pokemon by speed statistics
- Analyzes speed distributions across generations
- Correlates speed with other base stats

### Summary Statistics
- Provides comprehensive statistical overview of all numeric attributes
- Includes measures of central tendency and dispersion
- Highlights key statistical insights

## Data Visualization

### Count Plot Analysis
- Visualizes Pokemon type distributions
- Shows generation-wise Pokemon counts
- Illustrates type combinations frequency

### Pie Plot Analysis
- Shows proportional distribution of Pokemon types
- Visualizes legendary vs non-legendary ratio
- Displays generation-wise Pokemon distribution

### Box Plot and Violin Plot Analysis
- Demonstrates stat distributions across types
- Shows outliers in various statistics
- Compares distributions between different Pokemon categories

### Swarm Plot Analysis
- Visualizes individual Pokemon points across various metrics
- Shows clustering patterns in Pokemon stats
- Highlights relationships between different attributes

### Heat Map Analysis
- Displays correlation between different Pokemon stats
- Shows type effectiveness relationships
- Visualizes stat patterns across generations

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Source
The analysis uses a Pokemon dataset from kaggle which containing information about all Pokemon up to the latest generation, including their base stats, types, and other attributes
